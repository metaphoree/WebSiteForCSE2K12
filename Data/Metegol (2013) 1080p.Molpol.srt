Many years passed,

186
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,756
but never forgotten.

187
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:17,181
My small town, I'm happy to say that
our lives will be connected forever.

188
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,684
Why keep saying "my little town"?

189
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:24,021
Obvious. It is small and, moreover,

190
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,190
is mine.

191
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:32,196
As well, their?
Let's talk to the mayor.

192
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,489
Course. Mayor.

193
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,117
Talk later!

194
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,667
Bye, mayor. We do not need you.

195
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,420
Welcome to the new city.

196
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,798
A clear homage to the noblest of sports,

197
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,883
with the largest stadium in the world.

198
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,181
Tours.

199
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,601
Theme parks.

200
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,691
And a museum dedicated to the
most important person in history.

201
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,076
We do not want stadium here.

202
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,473
I have never forgotten you.

203
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,938
Or you.

204
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:02,411
Construction will begin today
and let's get this bar.

205
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,330
No.

206
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,257
No. Stop it!

207
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,846
Get out. Fast!

208
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,472
Stop them, please.

209
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,142
Impossible. You can not stop progress.

210
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,148
Sali, come on.

211
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,213
I want a rematch.

212
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,866
Wait. Can not do this to us.

213
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,870
Is a city is its people.

214
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,707
My City. Its people.

215
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,002
All this because of a game of foosball?

216
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,047
Please, of course not.

217
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,221
Bring me the foosball table
or not to return.

218
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:47,224
Please wait.

219
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,685
The city is always right.

220
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,229
Well, the city almost always right.

221
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,189
Please listen to me.

222
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:57,901
Please . I will not leave you
alone until you hear me.

223
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:00,404
I'm all ears.

224
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,240
What is this? No. Do not press the buttons.

225
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,830
Laura! Laura! Laura!

226
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,090
Laura!

227
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,665
Amadeo?

228
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:07,739
Amadeo?

229
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,159
Hey, Amadeo?

230
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,413
I'm here.

231
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,876
Amadeo.

232
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,714
Capi, are you?

233
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:27,300
Of course I am. Who else?

234
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,887
What is this guy? We are brothers or not?

235
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:34,057
3.724 were unbeaten matches.

236
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,350
What about?

237
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:36,726
This is a nightmare.

238
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,450
I'll wake up and everything will be fine.

239
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,564
The bar, my foosball table.

240
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,110
No.

241
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,737
Is not a nightmare.

242
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:51,408
No. Do not be discouraged now.

243
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:54,494
Do not be discouraged when
we can still turn it around.

244
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,288
- Are you kidding?
- Not!

245
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,082
- You have to animate and attack.
- Animate Me? What are you talking about?

246
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:02,794
I threw my life away playing
foosball and now I have nothing.

247
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,547
As well, it has nothing?

248
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,884
- Come here because you have more...
- Leave me alone.

249
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,637
Please stop, Amadeo.
Do not move, I have short legs.

250
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,891
I am a useless and now
Laura goes away and I...

251
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,351
I can not do anything,
I have nothing to hold Ia.

252
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,147
On top, I'm talking to
a piece of lead and think it's normal.

253
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,693
- Okay. Finished?
- Yes

254
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,612
I am not a piece of lead.

255
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:32,616
I'm left-winger and captain of
the best team Foosball World

256
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,826
and you are the undefeated champion.

257
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:39,623
Has unerring vision, perfect
balance and a supreme wrist.

258
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,125
Can not remember the
challenge with the neighbor?

259
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,670
He was destroying us and laughing at us.
Remember how he laughed?

260
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:50,342
- He was laughing at you as well.
-No. He did not laugh like that.

261
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:51,593
- He laughed as well.
-No.

262
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,678
- As he laughed, then?
- Like a squirrel. So...

263
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,629
And your friend who laughed...

264
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:00,060
- It is.
-'S.

265
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,979
We were losing 3-0 and turned to
4-3.

266
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,564
Amadeo, we are unbeatable.

267
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,025
The two of us together.
We do not need anyone else.

268
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:10,153
Come behind the faces made of iron.
Women come and go.

269
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:11,988
Do you think they come from?

270
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,825
Let her go, if you want.

271
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:19,204
If we have the whole team,
we fear no one.

272
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:23,166
We do what we must do, as with the
Gobero, Amadeo.

273
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,877
4 through 3. 4 A 3!

274
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,338
Do not need anyone. Nobody.

275
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,547
Not the city,

276
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,632
or the neighborhood,

277
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:31,716
or Laura...

278
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,093
No.

279
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,594
I need Laura.

280
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,054
And you will have Ia.

281
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:41,518
With the full team,
EI Grosso will not have a chance. 'll See.

282
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,896
-
Yes - Let's call the boys.

283
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,482
- Where?
- I do not know.

284
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,652
Inside foosball,
I know everything, but out here,

285
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,988
-'m lost.
- I know!

286
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,406
- Trash.
- Garbage.

287
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,782
Where is the trash?

288
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,242
I went. At the municipal deposit.

289
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,535
- The deposit!
- Let IA.

290
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,121
Even have defeated the
Gobero by 4-3, Amadeo?

291
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:04,124
Goals Beto, Loco and two mine.
Do not remember?

292
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:07,711
- His second was a corner.
- No. It was lateral.

293
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:14,217
- Where are we going?
- Nothing special, my summer home.

294
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,144
Hold on tight.

295
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,447
- I do not like that.
- It's pretty cool.

296
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,284
How so? I do this all day.

297
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,202
And the best part is yet to come.

298
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:42,662
Please do not!

299
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,406
Can you tell me how we will find them here?

300
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:21,618
Walkthrough.

301
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:25,789
<i>Let's calm down, roll up their sleeves
</ i> and <i> start </ i>

302
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,861
Wow! What a crazy trip.

303
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,489
Is. That's it!

304
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,534
The field got bigger.

305
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:16,047
Beto, Beto!

306
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,311
I'm out!

307
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:34,023
Help!

308
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,195
Not!

309
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,709
Saw what Bob did?

310
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,586
Are you Beto!

311
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,646
Loco! Beto!

312
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:16,191
- Capi!
- Good to see you.

313
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:18,902
You have no idea how the
separation was difficult.

314
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,738
Look at this. How about?

315
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,324
Beto want to do this.
He wants to break free.

316
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,411
<i>Olé! We are the champions </ i>

317
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:31,915
<i>Olé! We are the champions </ i>

318
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,375
Okay, come on.

319
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:38,505
- Spin, spin. Watch the hair.
- I'm free.

320
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:42,884
I'm free as the morning sun.
I am free.

321
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,471
How wonderful!

322
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:50,558
Bob has always been a great scorer.
Now, brace yourselves.

323
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,311
Goalscorer? I score goals, Beto.

324
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:00,276
Yes, Capi. Sorry. Beto was confused.

325
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,529
Great scorer.

326
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:07,283
Leave . I think it's crazy.

327
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,994
I hear. Again, I'm the scorer.

328
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,330
No. Really?

329
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:14,290
A mouse ate your brain?

330
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,876
Everyone knows that Bob has
always been the goal scorer.

331
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,962
And it's hard to be the scorer
this useless team.

332
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,214
As well, pointless team?

333
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,174
If I do not pass the ball,
all are lost.

334
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,553
- He hit his head.
-I'll hit your head, buck.

335
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:28,346
- I am the scorer.
- You better hold me.

336
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:31,266
Do not tease me.

337
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,476
I'm saying. Do not tease me.

338
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,895
- I'm that milestone goals.
- No, no.

339
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:41,818
Boys! This is not good for the sport.

340
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:46,281
We need to be united.
Aligned with the universe.

341
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:51,995
Is a goalscorer rainbow.

342
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,916
Need an ambulance to take this crazy guy.

343
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,627
- Go get you after I give you a way.
- Do not tease me.

344
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,754
- I'm serious.
- Get away from me.

345
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:04,549
Not even come close, but...

346
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:05,758
Enough ¡

347
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,345
We are alone, guys.

348
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:11,556
You are all I have left.

349
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:13,766
Amadeo.

350
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,519
I knew the tears

351
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:20,189
are mourning the soul
at sea of ​​existence?

352
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,442
- What did he say?
- Who Is Grieving?

353
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:25,403
- Loco. Why do not you shut up?
- Do not tell me to shut up.

354
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:27,322
Look...

355
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:33,953
Let's not confuse us. The sensitivity
is one thing and stupidity is another.

356
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,122
Stupidity is what you're saying now.

357
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,540
Shut up.

358
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:40,793
- Be quiet.
- Are interfering.

359
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:44,631
Bob is the scorer.

360
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:46,591
You guys are pathetic.

361
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,051
Straight?

362
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:51,137
- Lisandro, burgundy suits you well.
- Maroon.

363
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,514
You are beautiful. Straightened hair?

364
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,229
Now it is full of garbage here.

365
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,106
Why not get closer and say that
?

366
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,067
Have you asked politely.

367
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,903
I mean it in your face
30 years ago.

368
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,448
What is the problem? Are you afraid?

369
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,367
The mouse ate the tongue?

370
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:15,078
No, but maybe eat her.

371
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,835
- Show no fear.
- Look who's talking.

372
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:42,146
Come on!

373
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:47,985
Over there.

374
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,160
No. Beto did not enter.

375
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,165
Not!

376
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:40,997
Poor Beto.
The led and not defend.

377
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:44,041
- Not worth nothing.
- Not worthless.

378
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,752
E're worth everything.

379
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,170
What?

380
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:49,046
Do not listen. He thus speaks poor thing.

381
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:52,800
We have to go.
We can not stay in this house forever.

382
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,385
Is, the owner may appear.

383
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,596
Beto, Beto, Betito, Betito.

384
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:59,098
Know he was our top scorer, no?

385
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:04,061
He was our scorer.

386
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:05,897
And the best teammate.

387
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,774
Very humble.
Always thinking of others.

388
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:09,066
Poor Beto.

389
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:12,820
Capi. Beto has become
one with the universe.

390
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,615
When our time comes, we find
Io and'll be three.

391
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,283
With the universe?

392
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:19,619
With the universe, we are four.

393
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,412
So, with all, gives 12.

394
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:24,540
Let's put the universe on the bench
and start winning again.

395
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,626
Hey guys!

396
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:40,473
What are you doing there?
Get down, your buck.

397
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,734
Calm, animal.

398
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,403
E?

399
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:56,572
Felt the lack of Beto, right?

400
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:03,287
Please?
Who could miss?

401
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,122
Why he treats you like that?

402
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:08,000
Because otherwise he rides.
Do not see what you did with the mouse?

403
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:18,970
Where will the Amadeo is?

404
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:21,264
Look.

405
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:29,272
Left.

406
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:31,899
Left. Right.

407
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:34,110
Forward.

408
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,737
Back . Forward. Ali

409
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:38,781
We found him.

410
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,199
Go.

411
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,121
- They are taking.
- Look IA.

412
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:51,460
Come on, I do not know his name.

413
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,796
Quickly. We do not have all night.

414
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:56,966
Ew!

415
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:59,427
"I want foosball."

416
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:02,138
The things I do for him.

417
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,309
What are you doing, you idiot?

418
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,645
The idiot is dead and dangerous arrived.

419
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,985
Remember me!

420
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,445
My name is Amadeo.

421
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,824
Just saw? He was gone. Did it all myself.

422
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,784
No one is completely alone.

423
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:25,953
He was afraid.
Even I was scared of me.

424
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:27,496
Very cute. It was very good.

425
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,081
Now let's find the others.

426
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,836
Not!

427
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,507
Stay down.

428
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:41,677
Come on, pet.

429
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:19,048
No, Beto.

430
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:22,551
Do not do it again. Come back.

431
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,428
What are you doing?
Go look for it.

432
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:27,974
He did not give you your best self?
Ungrateful. Your rata.

433
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:31,143
Look. Your hair leave a trail.
Let's follow.

434
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,271
Bye, Claret. Looks like we have to go.

435
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:36,524
- Go leave me here?
- Has another plan?

436
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:39,819
- I do not think. 'm Pure feeling.
- Apparently Lisito.

437
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:42,780
- You have to stay here. Goodbye.
- Great.

438
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:45,825
And if you do not take me,
who will play against?

439
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:04,844
Welcome to my humble home.

440
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:09,932
What a beautiful statue.
I love abstract art.

441
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,435
Yes, yes.

442
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:15,312
I love this statue.

443
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,108
I admire your good taste.

444
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:20,609
Two of us.

445
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:38,794
- Come on.
- No, darling, this side here.

446
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,172
Tell him you are here on my behalf.

447
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:43,799
Calm, brother.

448
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,172
Things do not resolve well.

449
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:48,554
Wait.
With the crown jewels, not plays.

450
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:51,640
Do not you dare!

451
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:55,811
Stop it or rip your esophagus!

452
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,064
So many things still left me
to do in life!

453
00:39:58,147 --> 00:39:59,273
I'm Korean!

454
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,108
Never even seen the sea.

455
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:15,706
And now <i> </ i>

456
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,542
Boys! Here!

457
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:19,919
Bob, are you?

458
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:21,712
No, Beto left.

459
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:24,173
He left a message.

460
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:26,509
He loves all of you.

461
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:30,888
Get out of there. What are you doing?

462
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,393
Bob is not here.

463
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:38,604
Bob is gone.

464
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,815
Calm, friend.

465
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:42,566
Force

466
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:44,860
Force, Beto.

467
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:46,821
Bob did what he could.

468
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:48,447
Do not worry, brother.

469
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:50,116
They cut my hair.

470
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,535
I understand. The failure also hurt me.

471
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,703
But you're used to.

472
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,510
This will be impossible.

473
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:10,970
There's no way to find him.

474
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:14,473
It is better if we split up.

475
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:16,308
That's right, Captain. Divide and conquer.

476
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:17,434
's How it works.

477
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:19,979
- Tulio said that.
- Need to share the opponents, Loco.

478
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:23,440
- Tulio said.
- Stop that Tulio. Who cares?

479
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:34,785
Not!

480
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:39,790
Amadeo! Please!

481
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:41,667
Look what they did with us.

482
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,212
Hey, stop! Come back here.

483
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:55,347
Come on. You, I do not know his name.
Come with me.

484
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,191
Malpas.

485
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:26,712
Malpas.

486
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:28,464
Malpas. What have they done to you?

487
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:32,051
- Go, Capi. Save yourself while you can.
- No. I'm not leaving without you.

488
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:33,385
- Where's your brother?
- What brother?

489
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,346
How so?
Where's the other Malparitti?

490
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:37,598
Him .. Ali

491
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:41,560
- Ali? Not seeing.
-'Ll See soon.

492
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:52,488
- Malpas, hold my hand.
- No, hold my.

493
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:01,080
Not!

494
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:02,790
Beto feels hurt.

495
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:05,542
- Unable to continue.
- Come on.

496
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:10,714
Cactus complains of dry?
And still itches.

497
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:14,510
Come tingle.

498
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:26,675
I'm falling, Malpas. I can not...

499
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:29,024
Grab yourself. Has no team without you.

500
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:30,526
Goodbye, brother.

501
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,987
Thanks for giving me a hand, but
is too slippery.

502
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:40,494
How could you leave him fall, animal?
You worthless.

503
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:42,413
Say it to my face.

504
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:45,291
- I say to your face, quadruped.
- Draught, bipedal.

505
00:43:45,374 --> 00:43:48,502
- Hold the legs.
- I can not reach.

506
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:55,009
Do not yell. It's okay.

507
00:43:55,134 --> 00:43:57,803
Okay? Look down.

508
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,727
- What do we do now?
- That's why I'm crying.

509
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,104
In this case, continue.

510
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:16,655
Please get me out and take me home.
I look like a sheep?

511
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:20,075
Those idiots! Find them!

512
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:23,162
Do not overdo it.

513
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:25,456
- Talk right, Russian.
- Not really Chinese.

514
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:27,833
- I'm Korean.
- Okay!

515
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:30,127
May God bless you, brother.

516
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:32,546
Boys, calm. You can trust me.

517
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,128
Leave me alone!

518
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:14,922
Leave me alone!

519
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:19,009
- Having fun? Why not invite me?
- Bitter.

520
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:27,518
Awesome.
He ​​is even uglier up close.

521
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:29,728
If my hands were free...

522
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:14,690
Come on!

523
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:18,026
One, two, three...

524
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:21,029
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- Shut up, ugly.

525
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:22,656
're Right. He is ugly.

526
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:23,991
Do not mess with my brother.

527
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:26,535
About
you considered using as a garnish?

528
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:29,371
I'm not garnish. I'm a pin.

529
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:30,497
- What?
- That's right.

530
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,509
If you take me away, everything comes down.

531
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:04,031
What is the problem? Where do they go?

532
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,909
Do not go away. The best is yet to come.

533
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:18,587
Loco! Wait for us.

534
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,412
Courage, boys.

535
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:55,415
There has to be chance against
a team without arms and legs.

536
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:58,335
- Capi!
- Octopus!

537
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:03,298
- What have they done to you?
It's humiliating, Capi.

538
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:05,467
Made me burgundy.

539
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:09,388
Get out of there. Get him out of there.

540
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,098
Better dead than burgundy.

541
00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:13,350
Cowards!

542
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:16,311
Not ashamed to cry with
unfortunate companions?

543
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:18,772
No companions, although
bastards.

544
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,942
- Who called the bastard?
- Were always there.

545
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:25,237
Do not make me laugh.
I'm tired of picking up your ball.

546
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:26,655
- My?
- No, my sister.

547
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:28,574
Whenever you trashed.

548
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:31,159
- It?
- You think you're good!

549
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:34,162
- You calling me names?
- Yes, your buck.

550
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:35,998
Enough ¡

551
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:39,126
Look where we are.

552
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:42,087
Look around you.

553
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:47,092
Not realize that what unites us is
more than what divides us?

554
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:51,346
From now on,
let's work together. Right?

555
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:55,350
Have something you admire him?

556
00:48:57,686 --> 00:48:59,646
- It is...
I'm not listening.

557
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,523
- It is a good...-
Louder!

558
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:03,692
He is a good quarterback.

559
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:05,861
See how easy that was? Now, you. Come on.

560
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:09,364
It will not say what it is...

561
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,825
He is a great leader.

562
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:15,370
It is said that he is a great leader.
So what?

563
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:22,002
Lovely. We had a blast.

564
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:24,296
- We were afraid of you.
- From me?

565
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:26,882
You know we called you?

566
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,050
- Who, me?
- No, I do.

567
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:29,926
-
You. - No, you fool.

568
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:34,306
- Te we called "Buffalo".
- Really?

569
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:35,432
- Buffalo.
- Really?

570
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:36,516
Truth.

571
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,144
It was impossible to stop you.

572
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:41,271
Do you remember the time we played
three hours without stopping?

573
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:42,898
I remember like it was yesterday.

574
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:44,775
Old Thumbtack was still alive.

575
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:47,903
It was tough, but as he drank.

576
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:51,406
In the end, was so drunk that made me
rotate and break a window.

577
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:53,533
I remember it!

578
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:55,160
And the guy wanted me to pay!

579
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:05,420
It was pretty funny.

580
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,634
- Where are they?
- Ali

581
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,303
We mix a classic with a
modern foosball foosball.

582
00:50:13,387 --> 00:50:15,055
Give me the key.

583
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:47,796
Be careful, please!

584
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:52,509
Your hands are shaking, come on!

585
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:58,306
Now the lettuce is fresher.

586
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:03,311
Fresher?

587
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,481
Public Expensive

588
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:17,492
Bob came to say goodbye.

589
00:51:18,744 --> 00:51:19,828
He will go on tour.

590
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,541
Do not be humble, please.

591
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,170
Even if you beg, Beto can not stand.

592
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,674
Look at the bright side.
Without being overshadowed by me,

593
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:34,176
could grow.

594
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:37,804
Let me go, Amadeo. I'll kill you.

595
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:40,640
Get this clown wig!

596
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:43,685
's Why Beto goes away.

597
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:48,523
In the theater, there is no jealousy.
There is no envy.

598
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,693
All is harmony and applause.

599
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:58,450
Amadeo.

600
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:02,996
Amadeo. Led the edges.

601
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:05,874
- They took my team and we are burgundy.
- We must rescue them.

602
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:07,918
Need them.

603
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:13,715
Let's keep looking.

604
00:52:13,924 --> 00:52:15,801
Where are you going? Wait for me.

605
00:52:27,062 --> 00:52:28,688
- Look who's here.
- Who?

606
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:30,398
- Amadeo.
- Well at the right time.

607
00:52:58,969 --> 00:53:02,514
Wait for Beto. Do not let him here.

608
00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:04,975
Come here, Bob.

609
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:07,143
Is this you?

610
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:09,104
Are you, Betito?

611
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:12,566
Bob will not leave you.
He ​​knows they need it.

612
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:18,446
Amadeo.
Throw the ball and we play a little.

613
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:32,002
When is it?

614
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:34,671
It's too far.

615
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,073
Amadeo. Look at this.

616
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:11,958
What?

617
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:13,293
Laura is in danger.

618
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,963
Forget Laura. We are all together.
Do not need it.

619
00:54:17,172 --> 00:54:18,673
But she needs us.

620
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:20,967
She was, Amadeo. Forget.

621
00:54:21,176 --> 00:54:22,677
Should have seen her face.

622
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:24,554
I know. Come on.

623
00:54:24,888 --> 00:54:26,431
Please...

624
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:28,850
- Amadeo, women are...
- As mines.

625
00:54:28,934 --> 00:54:30,060
Exactly.

626
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,020
Not going anywhere. You will?

627
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:34,147
- No, I'm right here.
- Beto is.

628
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:35,899
This is my place in the world.

629
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:36,983
See?

630
00:54:56,044 --> 00:54:57,671
I feel...

631
00:54:58,004 --> 00:55:00,840
- I feel something...
- Right here. In the fourth chakra.

632
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:02,509
I also. An empty.

633
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:05,303
Beto feels pain in the chest.

634
00:55:05,762 --> 00:55:06,763
Beto...

635
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,849
It is a sadness.

636
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:12,394
Amadeo. Wait for us.

637
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:16,356
- We can keep looking if you want.
- Shut up, idiot!

638
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:20,402
At least I have something to
entertain this wayward boy.

639
00:55:25,532 --> 00:55:27,450
For the mansion, dizzy.

640
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:34,791
Do not know how to start.
No key. Only buttons.

641
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:36,668
Relax. It blue.

642
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:43,842
- What is the problem, asshole?
- A problem with visibility.

643
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:51,391
- What's wrong with the window?
- I do not know. It does not work.

644
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:54,973
Yes, of course. It was blue.

645
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:10,410
The Green...

646
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:13,788
- The green, no.
- Why did you say it was green?

647
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:16,624
Do not let me finish.
I would say: "Green, no."

648
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:21,212
This is a tribute to my shoulders, where
carry all games.

649
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:23,006
Sure, you play alone.

650
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:25,717
Believed that force me to play with ten?

651
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,427
This regulation has to end.

652
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:30,138
- This is me, throwing the disc.
- A disc.

653
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,892
The decorator said the same thing.

654
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:36,644
Quanta ignorant people... My goodness!

655
00:56:38,271 --> 00:56:39,856
This one always gets me.

656
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:43,318
Shows how frail I am like a child.

657
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,153
Good as a mother.

658
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:47,280
Simultaneously.

659
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:49,240
See! I'm creepy.

660
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:53,578
- And this?
- I do not know what this is doing.

661
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:57,165
- Come on.
- Not!

662
00:57:01,002 --> 00:57:03,922
So? Like me, right?

663
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:06,758
Why are you doing this?

664
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:09,302
Got money. Has fame.

665
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:10,762
Has success.

666
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:13,139
Why not leave the city in peace?

667
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:17,227
I did not.
Do you like me or not?

668
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:22,482
We can not fight you.
You will always win. You have everything.

669
00:57:22,649 --> 00:57:25,068
I have everything.
And not always won.

670
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:27,028
Once I lost. Do not you remember?

671
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:31,282
- I'm here.
- Right on time.

672
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:34,536
Come on.

673
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:37,997
Gimme that. I was looking for it.

674
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:40,166
Where are the others?

675
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:42,794
Useless leech. For support you?

676
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:44,546
Locate the rest.

677
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,923
Out!

678
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:50,343
- Dolls are harmless.
- Harmless?

679
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:53,596
They represent the only failure
of my life. Come on.

680
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:10,071
He is leading again! Not!

681
00:58:10,155 --> 00:58:13,825
He is leading again!

682
00:58:25,295 --> 00:58:27,630
- Here we are.
- There could have been?

683
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:29,883
Do not walk even ten
meters without sponsor.

684
00:58:42,854 --> 00:58:46,274
- What is this?
- The future of sports and their stars.

685
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:51,696
The best of nature and science,
and nanotechnology muscles.

686
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:55,450
Perfection. Perfecting the perfect.

687
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:59,495
- And this?
- White pigeons.

688
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,166
A tame animal with a neutral attitude,
are not good for IBOPE.

689
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:08,171
These are pigeons 2.0.
Warring and loyal to the team.

690
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,177
Australian ostrich is the fastest
animal in the world with a deadly kick.

691
00:59:14,344 --> 00:59:16,888
Imagine sneakers with
these characteristics?

692
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:21,184
- Give it to me.
- What will you do?

693
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:25,063
What would happen if I
mixed up this pile of crap

694
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:27,607
with this shoes?
- Stop, please.

695
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:32,695
Maybe I can boot
nails that make me stronger or at least

696
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:35,240
'll step on them for life.

697
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,618
Stop, please.

698
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:49,712
What will you do chinese?

699
00:59:51,214 --> 00:59:52,548
He is Korean.

700
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:54,884
What will he do?

701
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:56,719
He's thinking.

702
00:59:57,512 --> 01:00:00,515
Is another advantage we have
mixuruca about your team.

703
01:00:00,682 --> 01:00:03,682
- They will see him. I do not understand.
- Obviously you do not understand.

704
01:00:03,685 --> 01:00:06,479
You are dealing with a
master of oriental wisdom.

705
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:09,857
The guy can catch
things that you and I can not perceive.

706
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:12,443
Something that eludes
the rest of us mortals.

707
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:31,879
These numbers . I'm confused.

708
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:38,344
Always brute force, the strength stupid.

709
01:00:44,434 --> 01:00:49,063
What are you doing?
This will not help.

710
01:00:58,948 --> 01:01:01,200
Stop. Show more inventions.

711
01:01:01,284 --> 01:01:03,911
Come. Inventions.

712
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,415
No, wait. Stop.

713
01:01:11,336 --> 01:01:12,670
Let me go.

714
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:24,098
Is not how you do it.

715
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:29,937
Wow, that door hit me?

716
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,814
I have to teach you everything?

717
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:33,941
Ready?

718
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:37,779
Now!

719
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,704
What will you teach us?

720
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:54,170
There I go.

721
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:57,465
There I go.

722
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:08,059
Stop!

723
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:10,603
Not!

724
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:15,483
Please! Release.

725
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,319
- I'm not doing anything with it.
- Leave her alone.

726
01:02:18,403 --> 01:02:19,695
Do not mess with her.

727
01:02:44,053 --> 01:02:46,180
Cai. And there?

728
01:02:48,266 --> 01:02:51,936
Please, I beg you. Release.

729
01:02:52,145 --> 01:02:54,230
Do not tell me you like this idiot.

730
01:02:54,522 --> 01:02:56,357
And if I like it?

731
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:01,028
Not!

732
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:02,989
No.

733
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,995
I'll blow you
and with this filthy town!

734
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:30,892
- Over here, guys.
- Slowly.

735
01:03:36,898 --> 01:03:38,691
Laura.

736
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,737
Watch the hair.

737
01:03:42,904 --> 01:03:43,905
Come on.

738
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:55,249
What fauna is against Beto?

739
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:14,769
This is the worst preseason of my life.

740
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:17,772
- Do not give up now, Claret.
- Color Wine!

741
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:20,775
Capi!

742
01:04:20,983 --> 01:04:22,276
Loco!

743
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:26,322
Not!

744
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:36,123
Never be afraid to fly!

745
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:53,891
- Gonna explode!
- Amadeo!

746
01:05:13,536 --> 01:05:14,787
Bye.

747
01:05:25,673 --> 01:05:31,137
I'm fine. Thank God I saved
the most valuable thing. Myself.

748
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:42,273
If you did nothing,
I would be the most affected. E...

749
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:46,068
- Okay?
- Everything. Are you all right, Laura?

750
01:05:47,028 --> 01:05:48,029
Me? Alright.

751
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:53,743
I should not have done that, Amadeo.
He ​​is strong and well trained.

752
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:55,870
Should not have faced Io. It's crazy.

753
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:58,164
- I came to save you.
- It was wrong to do so.

754
01:05:58,289 --> 01:06:01,167
I can handle myself.
You know I care about you.

755
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:04,587
- I thought if I came and...
- What do you think?

756
01:06:04,837 --> 01:06:07,632
That I fall in love with you
for your courage, by face

757
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:09,884
a guy who is much stronger than you?

758
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,218
Is that what you thought?

759
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:16,349
A Time!

760
01:06:19,185 --> 01:06:20,936
I ¡defeat once.

761
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:23,609
Everyone knows that I
have never lost anything.

762
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:27,526
Once and I challenge you to a rematch
publicly.

763
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:32,114
- Want to challenge me?
- Anytime.

764
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:35,368
I accept your challenge.
But not a child's game.

765
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:38,454
I challenge you to a game of real football.

766
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,417
Football? I...

767
01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:45,878
You've always been a coward.

768
01:06:48,923 --> 01:06:50,341
When you want.

769
01:06:50,508 --> 01:06:51,592
A Time!

770
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:54,512
A game without a bet?
Let's make this interesting.

771
01:06:54,637 --> 01:06:56,889
If Amadeo win, you return
in the city.

772
01:06:58,891 --> 01:07:01,227
What? Are you afraid?

773
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:27,128
Hello!

774
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:29,130
Want to play a game in the new stadium?

775
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:32,174
- Sure. Against who?
-The Absolutes.

776
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:38,055
Want to show me how to play

777
01:07:38,139 --> 01:07:39,140
football?

778
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:45,646
Horrible. Weak. Lazy.
Go take five.

779
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:49,775
We have to play psychologically,
because they will kill us physically.

780
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:57,074
Want to...

781
01:07:57,158 --> 01:07:58,200
- Play...
- Football?

782
01:08:00,536 --> 01:08:02,037
Accepted then?

783
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:04,457
- Sure.

784
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:08,335
Hate. Hatred. Hatred.

785
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:35,780
Amadeo.

786
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:37,990
Look. I have a candidate.

787
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:42,286
Laucha,
say that is the fastest in town.

788
01:08:42,536 --> 01:08:44,497
- Is true?
- I borrow a pencil?

789
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:49,710
What...

790
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:53,839
He's not going anywhere.
You are in my custody.

791
01:08:54,507 --> 01:08:56,717
And not to watch him in the field?

792
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:05,226
What a surprise, Amadeo.

793
01:09:05,726 --> 01:09:07,394
Need of God's forgiveness?

794
01:09:07,603 --> 01:09:11,065
No, Father, I need a quarterback
and content myself with a priest.

795
01:09:18,781 --> 01:09:23,035
I can not return to the city until the
Helpless Sports

796
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,037
win the Copa Libertadores.

797
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:27,665
A promise is a promise.

798
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:29,083
Do not know what happened?

799
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:31,669
The Absolutes bought the Sport Helpless.

800
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:34,713
Ended up with the field
and built a megashopping.

801
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:42,847
Not!

802
01:09:53,107 --> 01:09:56,861
A player missing for us
and no more men in the city. Ideas?

803
01:09:57,611 --> 01:09:59,613
I have an idea.

804
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:04,076
Thank you for joining the team, but
could not shave his face until Sunday?

805
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:24,513
I have a question.
Do not know if we play 4-4-2 or 4-3-3.

806
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:27,516
Beto If I were you, it would play 11-0.

807
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,312
The eleven would lock in
to prevent goals.

808
01:10:43,991 --> 01:10:45,659
Amadeo.

809
01:10:45,784 --> 01:10:48,662
They will kill us.
Go to 20, 30 goals.

810
01:10:48,746 --> 01:10:50,664
What an exaggeration.

811
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:54,501
- Maybe ten or 15.
- They are stars.

812
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:55,794
We are terrible.

813
01:10:55,961 --> 01:10:58,505
- You are the best I know.
- In foosball. Do not understand?

814
01:10:58,589 --> 01:11:00,174
We are not real players.

815
01:11:00,633 --> 01:11:03,427
You, Bob and I mostly.
Do not worthless.

816
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:06,180
They are real. We are toys.

817
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:27,368
Hey, what's going on?

818
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,702
None.

819
01:11:28,786 --> 01:11:29,828
Like nothing? Crying.

820
01:11:29,954 --> 01:11:31,205
I'm not.

821
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:34,833
I was studying the topic

822
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,836
monoculture. Only pasture.

823
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:42,091
If not for me,
would not have happened, Amadeo.

824
01:11:42,174 --> 01:11:43,255
What are you talking about?

825
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:46,178
This. All this.
The Bar, the city, the challenge.

826
01:11:46,804 --> 01:11:47,888
What is the challenge?

827
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:50,557
As you have? Will slaughter us.

828
01:11:50,808 --> 01:11:53,936
We will lose everything.
Will score a thousand goals.

829
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:03,904
You have very little faith.

830
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:07,241
Not seen the team that set up?
Not seen in training?

831
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:11,203
's Why.

832
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:12,997
Not imagine how were the last days.

833
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,623
In both killed in train.

834
01:12:14,748 --> 01:12:16,375
But you are amateurs.

835
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:19,211
But we bet the city.
They do not bet anything.

836
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:22,047
Laurita,

837
01:12:23,966 --> 01:12:24,967
trust me.

838

Never seen anyone with as
much control of the game.

845
01:13:11,764 --> 01:13:12,973
I was good, no?

846
01:13:13,057 --> 01:13:14,178
I was not talking about you.

01:13:58,018 --> 01:14:00,395
One step too much to ask?

853
01:14:00,813 --> 01:14:02,439
Must be joking! What is your name?

854
01:14:02,523 --> 01:14:03,732
- Juan José
- There'll call your name.

855
01:14:03,816 --> 01:14:06,026

Calm, Capi! Listen to what is happening.

1077
01:31:20,226 --> 01:31:22,395
Whatever I Hear?
There is no sound.

1078

Amadeo! Amadeo.

1085
01:31:52,216 --> 01:31:53,217
Lost.

1086
01:31:56,095 --> 01:31:58,556
No matter, Amadeo.

1087
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:39,597
Who are applauding?

1088
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:42,391
Who are applauding?
Have to applaud me.

1089
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:44,852
They saw that I won?

1090
01:32:45,478 --> 01:32:48,564
I'm sorry.
But the public wants something different.

1091
01:32:49,148 --> 01:32:52,026
Idiot! There are screaming my name!
Why do I pay you?

1092
01:32:52,443 --> 01:32:55,363
No more pay me. I quit.

1093
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:57,949
What? It is nothing without me.

1094
01:32:58,157 --> 01:33:01,160
I'm the ruler. I am the star.

1095
01:33:01,494 --> 01:33:02,828
I am the idol.

1096
01:33:03,496 --> 01:33:05,289
Astros fade.

1097
01:33:06,165 --> 01:33:07,291
Idols fall.

1098
01:33:08,042 --> 01:33:10,336
Maiorais age.

1099
01:33:11,796 --> 01:33:15,591
Entrepreneurs are eternal.

1100
01:33:46,038 --> 01:33:48,374
I'd give you my shirt, but it is painted.

1101
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:51,377
I love you,... Color Claret Wine.

1102
01:33:52,211 --> 01:33:53,546
Friendship!

1103
01:33:53,629 --> 01:33:57,091
<i>Football is amazing!
And a box of surprises </ i>

1104
01:33:57,216 --> 01:34:00,928
<i>Not ask me how or why </ i>

1105
01:34:01,012 --> 01:34:05,057
<i>But the local team managed
to get into the game </ i>

1106
01:34:05,308 --> 01:34:07,893
<i>and played as equals
against Absolute </ i>

1107
01:34:18,738 --> 01:34:19,739
And what happened?

1108
01:34:19,822 --> 01:34:21,615
The residents chose to create a new city

1109
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:24,285
instead of living in the city of Grosso.

1110
01:34:24,368 --> 01:34:25,786
What happened to Amadeo?

1111
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:27,830
He just wanted to be the hero of Laurita.

1112
01:34:27,913 --> 01:34:30,041
Then got married and had a son.

1113
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,543
A beautiful son.

1114
01:34:32,626 --> 01:34:34,003
Do not believe any of it.

1115
01:34:34,086 --> 01:34:36,839
Foosball players.
Who will believe that?

1116
01:34:37,131 --> 01:34:41,218
I tell you a true story.
Believe it.

1117
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:44,805
These players even exist?
Are they alive?

1118
01:34:44,889 --> 01:34:46,515
Father! Can I see them?

1119
01:34:47,558 --> 01:34:48,851
Believe and you will see.

1120
01:35:15,628 --> 01:35:18,047
I didn't hit you. It's a tattoo.

1121
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:19,632
- That Tattoo?
- A Tattoo!

1122
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:21,050
So it seems I have tattoo.

1123
01:35:21,133 --> 01:35:22,885
<i>-Foul!
- Foul </ i>

1124
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:24,470
Looks like a ballerina.

1125
01:35:24,553 --> 01:35:25,679
13 meters, Amadeo.

1126
01:35:25,763 --> 01:35:28,140
- Amadea Amadeo.
-He has a tattoo, Amadeo.

1127
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:40,611
It's time, Son. Come on.

1128
01:35:53,499 --> 01:35:56,752
They are winning 2-1, but
we can turn the game.

1129
01:35:56,836 --> 01:35:58,337
You know football.

1130
01:35:58,671 --> 01:36:00,089
Anything can happen.

1131
01:36:01,298 --> 01:36:04,343
Come. Let's play.
